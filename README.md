## Page 3: Monte Carlo Prediction

The third page of the dashboard presents a Monte Carlo prediction graph based on stock volatility. Monte Carlo simulation is a technique that helps estimate the range of possible outcomes for a given investment by running multiple simulations based on historical data. By incorporating volatility, users can gain insights into the potential risk and return of their investment. The graph visualizes the range of possible future stock prices, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the investment's uncertainty.
